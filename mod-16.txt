Fill in the blanks-1

1) Fill the following blanks in the get method of BST

private Value get(Node x, Key key) { 
if (x == null) return ___________;     // Blank 1 
int cmp = key.compareTo(_____________);   // Blank 2
if (cmp < 0) 
return get(________, key);      // Blank 3
else if (cmp > 0) 
return get(___________, key);    // Blank 4
else return x.val; 
}

Blank1:-----------------------------null

Blank2:-----------------------------x.key

Blank3:-----------------------------x.left

Blank4:-----------------------------x.right

2) Fill the following blanks in the put method of BST

private Node put(Node x, Key key, Value val) { 
if (x == ______________)          // Blank 1
return new Node(key, val); 
int cmp = key.compareTo(___________);    // Blank 2
if (cmp < 0) 
x.left = put(_____________, key, val);    // Blank 3
else if (cmp > 0) 
x.right = put(_____________, key, val);   // Blank 4
else 
x.val = val; 
return x; 
}


Blank1:-----------------------------null

Blank2:-----------------------------x.key

Blank3:-----------------------------x.left

Blank4:-----------------------------x.right

3)Note: A BST is a binary tree where nodes are ordered in the following way:
each node contains one key (also known as data)
The keys in the left subtree are less than the key in its parent node, in short L < P;
The keys in the right subtree are greater the key in its parent node, in short P < R;
Duplicate keys are not allowed.

Following the above criteria, draw a BST for the following keys (you receive keys from left to right) and answer the below questions.

11, 6, 8, 19, 4, 17, 43, 49, 31

What will be the child nodes for element 6 ?
Answer: 2 child nodes(4,8)

How many leaf nodes in the resultant tree ?
Answer: 5 leaf nodes

How many compares (key compares) does it take to insert the last element(31) in to the tree?
Answer: 3 times it compares to insert last element.

How many compares (key compares) does it take when we call get(8) method ?
Answer: 2 times.



Learning by doing-1
Suppose that a certain BST has keys that are integers between 1 and 10, and we search for 5. Which sequence below cannot be the sequence of keys examined? Why?
a. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 
b. 4, 10, 8, 7, 3, 5
c. 1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 6, 5 
d. 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5 
e. 1, 2, 10, 4, 8, 5

Answer:
a. can be sequence of key(vaild)
b. can be sequence of key(vaild)
c. can be sequence of key(vaild)
d. The 8 is out of place. When it was inserted, it should have gone to the right of 7, but instead it's to the left, under 3.
e. can be sequence of key(vaild)
